## 🌍 Custom Procedural Terrain Generator - Runtime Infinite Terrain in a Custom C++ ECS Engine

*Custom Procedural Terrain Generator* was a solo technical research project focused on building a fully procedural, infinitely scalable terrain system inside a custom ECS-based C++ engine. The goal was to explore the balance between mathematical generation techniques, real-time performance constraints, and artistic control in large-scale environments.

The system generates heightmap-based terrain using multilayered noise, dynamic chunk streaming, biome blending, and shader-driven LOD through tessellation. Beyond technical implementation, the project focused heavily on system architecture, runtime efficiency, and exposing parameters for creative experimentation.

This project served as both an engine programming exercise and a deeper exploration into procedural world generation pipelines used in modern games.

## Project Goals & Through Process
Instead of starting from visuals, I approached the project from a systems perspective:
- How do large worlds scale without exhausting memory?
- How can deterministic generation enable infinite terrain?
- Where is the balance between randomness and artistic control?
- How can terrain be generated fast enough to support runtime streaming?

My design philosophy became:
> Build a deterministic, modular terrain pipeline where performance and flexibility drive decisions.
