*IgKnighted* is a fast-paced local multiplayer twin-stick arena shooter built in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints. Players fight waves of enemies while collecting power-ups and competing for high scores in a stylized, arcade-inspired environment.

The project focused on responsive combat systems, scalable difficulty balancing, and strong couch co-op readability, supported by in-engine animation logic and dynamic gameplay pacing systems.

*IgKnighted* was awarded the "Best Overall Game Year 1", "Best Art Year 1" and "Best Design Year 1" awards at our industry showcase day at BUAS.
